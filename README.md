## Description:
NSS group project

Design a group chat application that allows users to message each other. Those users must select their name from the options diplayed on the top of the page before entering text into the message box. 

## Exercise Requirements:
The application has to include a navbar with buttons to select a users name, an input button to send text, a clear all messages button, an option to change the theme of the webpage, an option to enhance the size of the text, and a logo that correlates to the name of the company (Waterwheels).

On the messages displayed there needs to be a timestap to show when the message was sent, there should also be an option to delete your own message from the thread.
